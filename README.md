# aer_ramsey_model_solver_iastate_econ602
Repository to contain working code and development to solve a specified Ramsey model for Econ 602, Fall 2020

Given the simplicity and static nature of this code, we've chosen not to use a cookiecutter approach.

A brief description of the relevant objects is given below:

* aer_ramsey_solver.ipynb is the solving code itself
* development_code contains the iterations of code leading up to the final product
* documentation has notes and a formal description of the requirements
* report contains the LaTeX and graphics necessary to generate the project report
